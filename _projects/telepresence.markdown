An interactive webcam viewer that allows the general public to watch live feeds from various earthqake monitoring sites. I wrote the back end in Node.js and the front end in Backbone with require.js. This is one of the first web applications I built, so, while the code might not be entirely solid, I learned a lot from the process and look back on it fondly.
