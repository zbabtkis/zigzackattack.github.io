I built and designed the Remote System monitor as a dashboard for checking the histories and current statuses of seismic data aquisition hardware across the United States. I use HighCharts to graph CPU usage and disk full samples. There are really too many cool visualizations to mention here, so why don't you check it out for yourself? There's plenty to click on!
